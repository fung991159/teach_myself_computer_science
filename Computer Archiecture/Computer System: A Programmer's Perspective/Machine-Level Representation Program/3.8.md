Assume the following values are stored at the indicated memory addresses and
registers:

| Address | Value | Register | Value |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 0x100   | 0xFF  | %rax     | 0x100 |
| 0x108   | 0xAB  | %rcx     | 0x1   |
| 0x110   | 0x13  | %rdx     | 0x3   |
| 0x100   | 0x11  |          |       |

Fill in the following table showing the effects of the following instructions,
in terms of both the register or memory location that will be updated and the
resulting value:

| Instruction             | Destination        | Value              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| addq %rcx,(%rax)        | 0x100              | 0x1 + 0xff = 0x100 |
| subq %rdx,8(%rax)       | 0x108              | 0xAB - 0x3 = 0xA8  |
| imulq $16,(%rax,%rdx,8) | 0x100 + 24 = 0x1F8 |                    |
| incq 16(%rax)           | 0x110              | 0x13 + 1 = 0x14    |
| decq %rcx               | %rcx               | 0x1 -1 = 0x0       |
| subq %rdx,%rax          |                    |
