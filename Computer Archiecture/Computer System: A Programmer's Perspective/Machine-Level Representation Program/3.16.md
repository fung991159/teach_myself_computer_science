A. Write a goto version in C that performs the same computation and mimics
the control flow of the assembly code, in the style shown in Figure 3.16(b).
You might find it helpful to first annotate the assembly code as we have done
in our examples.

```c
void cond(short a, short *p) {

    if (a == 0) {
      goto done;
    }

    if (*p > a) {
      goto done;
    }
    *p = a;
    
  done:
    return;
  
    
}

```

B. Explain why the assembly code contains two conditional branches, even
though the C code has only one if statement

> because in assembly the IF condition need to breaks down into TEST and CMP,
> first test a is not empty, second test if *p is smaller than a. 
>
> Interesting to note that this probably is the reason why conditoin in higher level
> programming level language is "short-circuit" in nature, because the
> conditions are break down and tested consecutively.
