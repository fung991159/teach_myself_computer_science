An alternate rule for translating if statements into goto code is as follows:

  t = test-expr;
  if (t)
    goto true;
  else-statement
  goto done;
true:
  then-statement
done:


A. Rewrite the goto version of absdiff_se based on this alternate rule.

```c
 long gotodiff_se(long x, long y)
 {
    long result;
    if (x >= y)
      goto x_ge_y;
    lt_cnt++;
    result = y - x;
    goto done;

  x_ge_y:
    ge_cnt++;
    result = x - y;

  done:
    return result;
 }

```


B. Can you think of any reasons for choosing one rule over the other?
