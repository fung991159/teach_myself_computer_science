A function test_two has the following overall structure:

```c
short test_two(unsigned short x) {
    short val = 0;
    short i;
    for (i = 1; i < 1; i++) {
        // Code inside the loop
        // ...
    }
    return val;
}

```

x in %rdi
```
test_two:
    movl    $1, %edx        // set i = 1
    movl    $65, %eax       // set val = 65
.L10:
    movq    %rdi, %rcx      // ?1 = x
    andl    $1, %ecx        // x = x & 1
    addq    %rax, %rax      // val += val
    orq     %rcx, %rax      // val = ? | val
    shrq    %rdi            // x = x >> 1, when x = 0 then ZF = 1
    addq    $1, %rdx        // i = i + 1
    jne     .L10
    rep; ret
```

Reverse engineer the operation of this code and then do the following:
A. Use the assembly-code version to fill in the missing parts of the C code.
> the solution in the back doesn't match the question at all!

B. Explain why there is neither an initial test before the loop nor an initial jump to the test portion of the loop
> the "shrq" will also change all the flag bits, here the zero flag will be 1 if the shift produces a zero result; which means if x is shifted to the point to 0, then the loop will stop and return val

C. Describe in English what this function computes.
