It is common to find assembly-code lines of the form

```
xorq %rcx,%rcx
```

in code that was generated from C where no exclusive-or operations were
present.
A. Explain the effect of this particular exclusive-or instruction and what useful
operation it implements.
> just setting the register to zero, since xoring a value itself is not going to return any other value

B. What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in
assembly code?
> 1. movq $0, %rcx, 2. subq %rcx, %rcx

C. Compare the number of bytes to encode any two of these three different
implementations of the same operation.
> xorq and subq takes 3 bytes, while movq takes 7 bytes since it involve also immediate value.
