| movb $0xF, (%ebx)   |                                                                           |
| movl %rax, (%rsp)   | the two operand is q, shoudl use movq                                     |
| movw (%rax),4(%rsp) | copy won't work between two memory                                        |
| movb %al,%sl        | no such register as "%sl"                                                 |
| movq %rax,$0x123    | IMMEDIATE value can't be destination, must be either register or memory   |
| movl %eax,%dx       | when movl has register as destinatoin, it will set hih-order poriton to 0 |
| movb %si, 8(%rbp)   | movb is 8 bit, the two operand is at least 16 bit, so should use movw     |
