Consider the following code, in which we have omitted the expression being
computed:

```c
short arith3(short x, short y, short z)
{
    short p1 = y | z;
    short p2 = p1 >> 9;
    short p3 = ~p2;
    short p4 = y - p3;
    return p4;
}
```
The portion of the generated assembly code implementing these expressions
is as follows:

short arith3(short x, short y, short z)
x in %rdi, y in %rsi, z in %rdx

```
arith3:
    orq %rsi, %rdx  
    sarq $9, %rdx
    notq %rdx
    movq %rdx, %bax
    subq %rsi, %rbx
    ret
```

Based on this assembly code, fill in the missing portions of the C code.

>> not sure what exactly is a "%bax" register
