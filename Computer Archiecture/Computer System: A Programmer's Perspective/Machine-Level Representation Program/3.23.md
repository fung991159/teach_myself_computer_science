For the C code
```c
short dw_loop(short x) {
  short y = x/9;
  short *p = &x;
  short n = 4*x;
  do {
    x += y;
    (*p) += 5;
    n -= 2;
  } while (n > 0);
  return x;
}
```

short dw_loop(short x)
x initially in %rdi

```assembly
gcc generates the following assembly code:
 dw_loop:
  movq %rdi, %rbx     // tmp = x
  movq %rdi, %rcx     // y = x
  idivq $9, %rcx      // y = x / 9
  leaq (,%rdi,4), %rdx  // n = 4 * x
 .L2:
  leaq 5(%rbx,%rcx), %rcx   // y = x + y + 5, 5 being pointer increment
  subq $2, %rdx             // decrement n by 2 (typo in textbook)
  testq %rdx, %rdx          // test n
 jg .L2                     // if n > 0, goto L2
 rep; ret

```

A. Which registers are used to hold program values x, y, and n?
> x: %rbx, y: %rcx, n: %rdx

B. How has the compiler eliminated the need for pointer variable p and the pointer dereferencing implied by the expression (*p)+=5?
> the compiler simple use value of x and y as address of variable p, and store the output in %rcx

C. Add annotations to the assembly code describing the operation of the program, similar to those shown in Figure 3.19(c).
> done. It seems there is a few typo in this exercise. For example the decrement should be n-2 instead of n-1. Also leaq should load into x (%rbx) instead of y (%rcx). But generally it works.
