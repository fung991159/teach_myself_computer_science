In the following excerpts from a disassembled binary, some of the information has
been replaced by X’s. Answer the following questions about these instructions.

A. What is the target of the je instruction below? (You do not need to know
anything about the callq instruction here.)

4003fa: 74 02   je      XXXXXX
4003fc: ff d0   callq   *%rax

> 0xfc + 0x02 = -4 + 2 = -2 = 4003fe

B. What is the target of the je instruction below?
40042f: 74 f4   je      XXXXXX
400431: 5d      pop     %rbp

> 0x31 + f4 = 49 + (-12) = 37 = 0x25 = 400325


C. What is the address of the ja and pop instructions?
XXXXXX: 77 02    ja     400547
XXXXXX: 5d       pop    %rbp

> 4005{pop_address} + 0x02 = 400547, pop_address = 0x45. since ja instruction take 2 bytes, so ja instruction location is 400545 - 0x02 = 400543

D.In the code that follows, the jump target is encoded in PC-relative form as a 4-
byte two’s-complement number. The bytes are listed from least significant to
most, reflecting the little-endian byte ordering of x86-64. What is the address
of the jump target?
4005e8: e9 73 ff ff ff      jmpq    XXXXXXX
4005ed: 90                  nop

> 0xffffff73 = -141 + 237 = 96 = 0x60 = 400560
