Executing a continue statement in C causes the program to jump to the end of
the current loop iteration. The stated rule for translating a for loop into a while
loop needs some refinement when dealing with continue statements. For example,
consider the following code:

```c
/* Example of for loop containing a continue statement */
/* Sum even numbers between 0 and 9 */
long sum = 0;
long i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i & 1)
    continue;
  sum += i;
}
```




A. What would we get if we naively applied our rule for translating the for loop
into a while loop? What would be wrong with this code?
```assembly
i = 0
while (i<10) {
  if (i&1)
    continue;
  sum += i;
  i += 1
}
```
> The loop will continue forever, since the continue in body-statment is before
> i increment

B. How could you replace the continue statement with a goto statement to
ensure that the while loop correctly duplicates the behavior of the for loop?
> Just replace "continue" with "goto loop" to ensure sum line is skipped if i is even.

```
/* Correct translation of for loop into while loop */
long sum = 0;
long i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i & 1)
    goto update;
  sum += i;
update:
  i++;
}
```
