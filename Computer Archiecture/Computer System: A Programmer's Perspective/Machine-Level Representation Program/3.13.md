The C code

```c
int comp(data_t a, data_t b) {
    return a COMP b;
}
```

shows a general comparison between arguments a and b, where data_t, the data
type of the arguments, is defined (via typedef) to be one of the integer data types
listed in Figure 3.1 and either signed or unsigned. The comparison COMP is defined
via #define.

Suppose a is in some portion of %rdx while b is in some portion of %rsi. For
each of the following instruction sequences, determine which data types data_t
and which comparisons COMP could cause the compiler to generate this code.
(There can be multiple correct answers; you should list them all.)


A.  cmpl %esi, %edi
    setl %al
> compl is 32 bit, so data_t can be int or unsigned, setl means signed "<", so data_t must be int

B. cmpw %si, %di
   setge %al
> cmpw is 16 bit, setge is for signed ">". so data_t is short

C. cmpb %sil, %dil
   setbe %al
> cmpb is 8 bit, setbe is for unsigned <=. So data_t is "unsigned char"

D. cmpq %rsi, %rdi
   setne %a
> cmpq is 64 bit, setne is "not equal / not zero", but apply to both sign and unsigned. So data_t can either be long long or unsigned long long
