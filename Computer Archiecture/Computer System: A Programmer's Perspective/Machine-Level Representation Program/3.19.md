Running on a new processor model, our code required around 45 cycles when the
branching pattern was random, and around 25 cycles when the pattern was highly
predictable.

A. What is the approximate miss penalty?
> Tavg (p) =  Tok + p*Tmp
> Tavg(0.5) = Tok + 0.5Tmp
> TMP = 2(Tran âˆ’ TOK ) = 2*(45 - 25) = 40

B. How many cycles would the function require when the branch is mispre-
dicted?
> mispredicted cycles required = Tok + Tmp = 25 + 40 = 65
