The C code
```c
int test(data_t a) {
    return a TEST 0;
}
```

shows a general comparison between argument a and 0, where we can set the
data type of the argument by declaring data_t with a typedef, and the nature
of the comparison by declaring TEST with a #define declaration. The following
instruction sequences implement the comparison, where a is held in some portion
of register %rdi. For each sequence, determine which data types data_t and which
comparisons TEST could cause the compiler to generate this code. (There can be
multiple correct answers; list all correct ones.)

A. testq %rdi, %rdi
   setge %al

> "q" is 64bit, setge is signed ">=", so data_t is long

B. testw %di, %di
   sete %al
> "w" is 16bit, sete doesn't indicate signess, so data_t can be either short or unsigned short

C. testb %dil, %dil
   seta %al
> "b" is 8 bit, seta is unsigned >, so data_t is unsigned char

D. testl %edi, %edi
   setle %al
> "l" is 32 bit, setle is "signed <=", so data_t is int
