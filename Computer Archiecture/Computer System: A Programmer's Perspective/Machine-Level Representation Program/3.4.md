Assume variables sp and dp are declared with types
    src_t *sp;
    dest_t *dp;

where src_t and dest_t are data types declared with typedef. We wish to use
the appropriate pair of data movement instructions to implement the operation
    *dp = (dest_t) *sp;

Assume that the values of sp and dp are stored in registers %rdi and %rsi,
respectively. For each entry in the table, show the two instructions that implement
the specified data movement. 

The first instruction in the sequence should read
from memory, do the appropriate conversion, and set the appropriate portion of
register %rax.

The second instruction should then write the appropriate portion
of %rax to memory. In both cases, the portions may be %rax, %eax, %ax, or %al,
and they may differ from one another.

Recall that when performing a cast that involves both a size change and a
change of “signedness” in C, the operation should change the size first (Section
2.2.6).
