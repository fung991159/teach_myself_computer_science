You are given the following information. A function with prototype

void decode1(long *xp, long *yp, long *zp);

is compiled into assembly code, yielding the following:

```
void decode1(long *xp, long *yp, long *zp)
xp in %rdi, yp in %rsi, zp in %rdx

decode1:
movq (%rdi), %r8   // get x at xp. Set to 5th argument
movq (%rsi), %rcx // get y at yp, set as 4th argument
movq (%rdx), %rax // get z at zp, set as return value
movq %r8, (%rsi) // write 5th argument to yp
movq %rcx, (%rdx) // write 4th argument to zp
movq %rax, (%rdi) // write return value to xp
ret
```

Parameters xp, yp, and zp are stored in registers %rdi, %rsi, and %rdx, respectively.

Write C code for decode1 that will have an effect equivalent to the assembly code shown.

> pretty intersting to do this translation, but can't image if the code is little bit more complicated.

```
void decode1(long *xp, long *yp, long *zp)
{
    long x = *xp;
    long y = *yp;
    long z = *zp;

    *yp = x;
    *zp = y;
    *xp = z;
}
```
