Write code to implement the following function:
/* Return 1 when x contains an odd number of 1s; 0 otherwise.
Assume w=32 */
int odd_ones(unsigned x);
Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164),
except that you may assume that data type int has w = 32 bits.
Your code should contain a total of at most 12 arithmetic, bitwise, and logical
operations.

```
int odd_ones(unsigned x)
{
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&x, sizeof(x)); // 0x12345678

    x ^= x >> 16;
    x ^= x >> 8;
    x ^= x >> 4;
    x ^= x >> 2;
    x ^= x >> 1;
    unsigned output = x & 1;
    return output;
};
