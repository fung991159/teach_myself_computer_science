As we will see in Chapter 3, the lea instruction can perform computations of the form (a<<k) + b, where k is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and b is either 0 or some program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform
multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute 3*a as (a<<1) + a.

Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all possible values of k,
what multiples of a can be computed with a single lea instruction?

### (a<<k)  = x * 2 ^ k
| k   | a<<1 | b   | (a<<k) + b |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---------- |
| 0   | a    | a   | 2a         |
| 0   | a    | 0   | a          |
| 1   | 2a   | a   | 3a         |
| 1   | 2a   | 0   | 2a         |
| 2   | 4a   | a   | 5a         |
| 2   | 4a   | 0   | 4a         |
| 3   | 8a   | a   | 9a         |
| 3   | 8a   | 0   | 8a         |

so the answer is 1,2,3,4,5,8,9
