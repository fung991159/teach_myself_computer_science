As we will see in Chapter 3, the lea instruction can perform computations of the
form (a<<k) + b, where k is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and b is either 0 or some
program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform
multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute 3*a as (a<<1) +
a. Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all possible values of k,
what multiples of a can be computed with a single lea instruction?
