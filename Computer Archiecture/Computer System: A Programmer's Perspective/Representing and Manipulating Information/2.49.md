A. For a floating-point format with an n-bit fraction, give a formula for the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly (because it would require an (n + 1)-bit fraction to be exact). Assume the exponent field size k is large enough that the range of representable exponents does not provide a limitation for this problem.

The number has binary representation 1, followed by n zeros, followed by 1,
giving value 2^(n+1) + 1.

B. What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format (n =
23)?
> 2^(n+1)+1 = 2^24+1 = 16777217
