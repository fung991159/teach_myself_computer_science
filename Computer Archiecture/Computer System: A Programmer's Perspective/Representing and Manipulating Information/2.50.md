Show how the following binary fractional values would be rounded to the nearest
half (1 bit to the right of the binary point), according to the round-to-even
rule. In each case, show the numeric values, both before and after rounding.

A. 10.111 
> round up
> before: 2 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 =  2.875
> after: 11.0 (3)

B. 11.010
> round to even
> before: 2 + 1 + 1/4 = 3.25
> after: 11.0 (3)

C. 11.000
> just chop off the 0
> before: 2 + 1 = 3
> after: 11.0 (3)

D. 10.110
> round to even
> before: 2 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 2.75
> after: 11.0 (3)
