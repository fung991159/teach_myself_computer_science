Assume variables x, f, and d are of type int, float, and double, respectively. Their values are arbitrary, except that neither f nor d equals +∞, −∞, or NaN.
For each of the following C expressions, either argue that it will always be true
(i.e., evaluate to 1) or give a value for the variables such that it is not true (i.e.,
evaluates to 0).

Orginal type
x: int
f: float
d: double


A. x == (int)(double) x
> Integer > Double > Integer \
> True. double has greater range than integer

B. x == (int)(float) x
> Integer > Float > Integer \
> Number maybe be rounded when cast from integer to float
> 
C. d == (double)(float) d
> Double > Float > Double \
> Double can hold more numerical values than float, so there can be overflow,
> also it can be rounded due to float smaller precision
> 
D. f == (float)(double) f
> Float > Double > Float \
> no issue at all.
> 
E. f == -(-f)
> Float > Float
> negation is just flipping the sign bit

F. 1.0/2 == 1/2.0
> Double > Double
> 1.0/2 is double, 1/2.0 is double, so this is always true

G. d*d >= 0.0
> False. it is possible that d*d overflow.

H. (f+d)-f == d
