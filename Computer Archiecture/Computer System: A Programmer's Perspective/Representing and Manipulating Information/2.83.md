Consider numbers having a binary representation consisting of an infinite string
of the form 0.y y y y y y . . . , where y is a k-bit sequence. For example, the binary
representation of 3 1 is 0.01010101 . . . (y = 01), while the representation of 5 1 is
0.001100110011 . . . (y = 0011).

A. Let Y = B2U k(y), that is, the number having binary representation y. Give
a formula in terms of Y and k for the value represented by the infinite string.
Hint: Consider the effect of shifting the binary point k positions to the right.

B. What is the numeric value of the string for the following values of y?
(a) 101
> n = 5 / (2^3-1) = 5/7

(b) 0110
> n = 6 / (2^4-1) = 6/15 = 2/5

(c) 010011
> n = 19 / (2^6-1) = 19/63
