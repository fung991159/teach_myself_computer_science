Fill in code for the following C functions. Function srl performs a logical right
shift using an arithmetic right shift (given by value xsra), followed by other oper-
ations not including right shifts or division. Function sra performs an arithmetic
right shift using a logical right shift (given by value xsrl), followed by other
operations not including right shifts or division. You may use the computation
8*sizeof(int) to determine w, the number of bits in data type int. The shift
amount k can range from 0 to w âˆ’ 1.

> actually srl and sra are more or less the same, the only difference is how to
> apply the mask, the key is to get to the right mask
