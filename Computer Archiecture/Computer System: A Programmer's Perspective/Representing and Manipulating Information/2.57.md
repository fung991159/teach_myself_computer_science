Write procedures show_short, show_long, and show_double that print the byte
representations of C objects of types short, long, and double, respectively. Try
these out on several machines.

refer to 2.57.c, given the numeric number "200", the output for short, long, and double are:

```
 c8 00
 c8 00 00 00
 00 00 00 00 00 00 69 40
```

As we can see, the bits length for short is 16 bits, long is 32 bits, and double
is 64 bits. hence this has implication of the numerical range each type can represents
