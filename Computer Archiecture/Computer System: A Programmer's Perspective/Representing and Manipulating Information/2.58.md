Write a procedure is_little_endian that will return 1 when compiled and run
on a little-endian machine, and will return 0 when compiled and run on a big-
endian machine. This program should run on any machine, regardless of its word
size.

Solution:
> the typical answer is function "is_little_endian" that doesn't really explain anything
>
> I have broken down the function into steps to show how it works with
> "is_little_endian_with_steps", it takes basic understanding how hexdeciaml,
> binary, bytes, and C's pointer, int, chr type works
```
int is_little_endian()
{
    int x = 1;
    return *(char *)&x;
}

void is_little_endian_with_steps()
{
    int x = 1;       // create a int variable
    int *ptr_x = &x; // assign the address of int x to an int
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)ptr_x, sizeof(int));
    char *chr_ptr = (char *)ptr_x; // cast the x integer pointer into char pointer, since char is 1 byte, so the first byte of x is the first byte of the char pointer
    int result = *chr_ptr;         // get the value of the first byte

    printf("result (int) = %d\n", result);
    // print binary representation of x
    // printf("%d\n", *ptr);/
}```
