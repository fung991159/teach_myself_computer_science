With bis, the modification involves setting z to 1 at each bit position where m
is 1.  (OR)
With bic, the modification involves setting z to 0 at each bit position where m
is 1.   (NOT)


int bool_or(int x, int y) {
    int result = bis(x, y)
    return result;
}


int bool_xor(int x, int y) {
    int result = bis(bic(x, y), bic(y, x))
    return result;
}


>> bis is equivlent of OR gate
>> not sure how bool_xor was achieved though
