Assume data type int is 32 bits long and uses a twoâ€™s-complement representation for signed values. Right shifts are performed arithmetically for signed values and logically for unsigned values. The variables are declared and initialized as follows:
```
    int x = foo(); /* Arbitrary value */
    int y = bar(); /* Arbitrary value */

    unsigned ux = x;
    unsigned uy = y;
```
For each of the following C expressions, either (1) argue that it is true (evaluates to 1) for all values of x and y, or (2) give values of x and y for which it is false (evaluates to 0):

A. (x > 0) || (x-1 < 0)
> False. if x is Tmin, then -1 will bring it to Tmax., making (x-1 < 0) False

B. (x & 7) != 7 || (x<<29 < 0) \

> True. (x & 7) masking extract the last 3 bit of x, when x = 7, (x & 7) != 7 is false
> However, when x = 7, (x<<29 < 0) will certainly shift the 3 one bit from least signifcant to most significant. Hence making it True.

C. (x * x) >= 0 \
> False. This is gonna overflow and return negative value

D. x < 0 || -x <= 0 \
> True. Negation of a Tmin is going to be TMin. But the comparsion is still valid

E. x > 0 || -x >= 0 \
> False. Negation of a TMin is going to be TMin. So if x is negative, -x>=0 is gonna be false.

F. x+y == uy+ux \
> False. unsigned and signed number represent different number range when the most significant bit is 1

G. x*~y + uy*ux == -x
> False. Too many variable: 1. negation of y can stay y if it is Tmin. 2. x* uy*ux is going to overflow
