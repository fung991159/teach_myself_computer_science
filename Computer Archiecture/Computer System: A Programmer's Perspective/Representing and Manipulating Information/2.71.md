You just started working for a company that is implementing a set of procedures
to operate on a data structure where 4 signed bytes are packed into a 32-bit
unsigned. Bytes within the word are numbered from 0 (least significant) to 3
 
(most significant). You have been assigned the task of implementing a function
for a machine using twoâ€™s-complement arithmetic and arithmetic right shifts with
the following prototype:

```
/* Declaration of data type where 4 bytes are packed
into an unsigned */
typedef unsigned packed_t;
/* Extract byte from word. Return as signed integer */
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum);
```
That is, the function will extract the designated byte and sign extend it to be a 32-bit int.
Your predecessor (who was fired for incompetence) wrote the following code:
```
/* Failed attempt at xbyte */
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
{
return (word >> (bytenum << 3)) & 0xFF;
}
```
A. What is wrong with this code?
> the code just take the target byte without extending it to 32 bits

B. Give a correct implementation of the function that uses only left and right
shifts, along with one subtraction.
> Just shift the bits around and let the system do the arihemitc operation
```
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
{
    int shift_pos = (bytenum << 3);
    int target_bytes = (word >> shift_pos) & 0xFF;
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&target_bytes, sizeof(int));

    // put target_bytes back to msb positon
    int back_to_msb = target_bytes << (32 - shift_pos);
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&back_to_msb, sizeof(int));

    // hard code right shift 24 bits, since we just want to extend it
    int output = back_to_msb >> 24;
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&output, sizeof(int));
    // return target_bytes;
}
```
