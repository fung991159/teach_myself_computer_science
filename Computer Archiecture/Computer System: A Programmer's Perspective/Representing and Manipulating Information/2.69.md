Write code for a function with the following prototype:
/*
* Do rotating left shift. Assume 0 <= n < w
* Examples when x = 0x12345678 and w = 32:
*
 n=4 -> 0x23456781, n=20 -> 0x67812345
*/
unsigned rotate_left(unsigned x, int n);
Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164). Be
careful of the case n = 0.
> this one is pretty straight forward, just divide the bit to rotating parts and
> shift it accordingly. Finally OR them together

```
unsigned rotate_left(unsigned x, int n)
{
    // 1. extract rotating n bits starting from msb:
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&x, sizeof(unsigned));
    unsigned right_part = (x << n); // 0x23456780
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&right_part, sizeof(unsigned));

    unsigned left_part = (x >> (32 - n)); // 0x00000001
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&left_part, sizeof(unsigned));
    return (x << n) | (x >> (32 - n));
};
```
