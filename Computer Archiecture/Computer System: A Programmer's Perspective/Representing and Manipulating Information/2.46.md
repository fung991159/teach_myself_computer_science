### A. What is the binary representation of 0.1 − x?
0.1 in binary =  0.000110011[0011]...
x is consiered as first 23 bit: x = 0.00011001100110011001100

 the exponent field is interpreted as representing a
signed integer in biased form. That is, the exponent value is E = e − Bias, where
e is the unsigned number having bit representation ek−1 . . . e1e0 and Bias is a bias
value equal to 2k−1 − 1 (127 for single precision and 1023 for double). This yields
exponent ranges from −126 to +127 for single precision and −1022 to +1023 for
double precision.
The fraction field frac is interpreted ahence 0.1 - x = 0.00000000000000000000000[0011][0011]...

### B. What is the approximate decimal value of 0.1 − x?
0.1 - x ≈ 9.54 × 10^-8

### C. The clock starts at 0 when the system is first powered up and keeps counting up from there. In this case, the system had been running for around 100 hours. What was the difference between the actual time and the time computed by the software?
9.54 × 10^-8 * 60 * 60 * 100 * 10 (system increment per 0.1 seconds) = 0.34344
seconds

### D. The system predicts where an incoming missile will appear based on its velocity and the time of the last radar detection. Given that a Scud travels at around 2,000 meters per second, how far off was its prediction?

2000 * 0.034344 = 687 meters
