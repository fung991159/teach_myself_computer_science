### A. What is the binary representation of 0.1 − x?
0.1 in binary =  0.000110011[0011]...
x is consiered as first 23 bit: x = 0.00011001100110011001100

hence 0.1 - x = 0.00000000000000000000000[0011][0011]...

### B. What is the approximate decimal value of 0.1 − x?
0.1 - x ≈ 9.54 × 10^-8

### C. The clock starts at 0 when the system is first powered up and keeps counting up from there. In this case, the system had been running for around 100 hours. What was the difference between the actual time and the time computed by the software?
9.54 × 10^-8 * 60 * 60 * 100 * 10 (system increment per 0.1 seconds) = 0.34344
seconds

### D. The system predicts where an incoming missile will appear based on its velocity and the time of the last radar detection. Given that a Scud travels at around 2,000 meters per second, how far off was its prediction?

2000 * 0.034344 = 687 meters
