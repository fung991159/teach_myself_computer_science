Write code for the function with the following prototype:
/*
* Return 1 when x can be represented as an n-bit, 2â€™s-complement
* number; 0 otherwise
* Assume 1 <= n <= w
*/
int fits_bits(int x, int n);
Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164).

> The essene of this function is to check the bits outside of n bits
> representation. If positive they should be all 0s
> or for negative number they need to be all 1s, either condition not met will
> be overflow
```
int fits_bits(int x, int n)
{
    printf("original bits:");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&x, sizeof(unsigned));

    // retain only the bits to the left of n
    int outer_bits = x >> n;
    printf("outer_bits:");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&outer_bits, sizeof(unsigned));

    // if n is a postive number, then all the forward bits will be 0
    printf("leading_bit_all_zeros:");
    int leading_bit_all_zeros = (outer_bits == 0);
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&leading_bit_all_zeros, sizeof(unsigned));

    // if n is a negative number, then all the forward bits will be 1
    printf("leading_bit_all_ones:");
    int all_ones = ~0;
    int leading_bit_all_ones = (outer_bits == all_ones);
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&leading_bit_all_ones, sizeof(unsigned));

    // check if above conditions are met, if either of them is not true, then x
    // cannot represent as an n bits
    int output = leading_bit_all_zeros | leading_bit_all_ones;
    return output;
}
