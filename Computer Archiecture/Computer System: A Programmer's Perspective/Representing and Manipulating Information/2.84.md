Fill in the return value for the following procedure, which tests whether its first
argument is less than or equal to its second. Assume the function f2u returns an
unsigned 32-bit number having the same bit representation as its floating-point
argument. You can assume that neither argument is NaN. The two flavors of zero,
+0 and âˆ’0, are considered equal.

> basically we just need to check for the 3 conditions

```
int float_le(float x, float y) {
unsigned ux = f2u(x);
unsigned uy = f2u(y);
/* Get the sign bits */
unsigned sx = ux >> 31;
unsigned sy = uy >> 31;
/* Give an expression using only ux, uy, sx, and sy */
    return (
        // 1. check if both x & y is zero
        (ux << 1 == 0) && (uy << 1 == 0) ||
        // 2. if x & y is different sign, return 1 if x is negative
        ((sx != sy) && sx) ||
        // 3. if x & y is same sign, check if x is smaller than y
        ((sx == sy) && ux <= uy));
}
```
