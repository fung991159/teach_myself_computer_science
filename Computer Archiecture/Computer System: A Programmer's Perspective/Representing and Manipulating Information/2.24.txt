Suppose we truncate a 4-bit value (represented by hex digits 0 through F) to a 3-bit value (represented as hex digits 0 through 7.) Fill in the table below showing the effect of this truncation for some cases, in terms of the unsigned and two’s-complement interpretations of those bit patterns.

      Hex                     Unsigned                   Two’s complement
Original Truncated      Original Truncated              Original   Truncated
    1       1               1     0001=001=1, 1%8=1         1        U2T(1)=1
    3       3               3     0011=011=3, 3%8=3         3        U2T(3)=3
    5       5               5     0101=101=5, 5%8=5         5        U2T(5)=5
    C       4               12    1100=100=4, 4%8=4        -4        U2T(4)=4
    E       6               14    1110=110=6, 6%8=6        -2        U2T(6)=6

Explain how Equations 2.9 and 2.10 apply to these cases.
>> as 2.9 suggested, for unsigned value the truncate numerical value is modulo of 8. 

But in two's complement representation, we must go the same unsigned truncation process, only to turn the output from unsigned binary to signed binary.
