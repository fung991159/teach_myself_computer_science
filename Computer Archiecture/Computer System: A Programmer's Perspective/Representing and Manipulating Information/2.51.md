We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as x =
0.00011001100110011001100 . Suppose instead that they had used IEEE
round-to-even mode to determine an approximation x‘ to 0.1 with 23 bits to the
right of the binary point.
A. What is the binary representation of x‘?
> since the trailing bit is gonna be "1", and the following bits won't be all
> zero, so this is a round up case, hence the result is 0.00011001100110011001101.

B. What is the approximate decimal value of x’ − 0.1?
> decimal value of x' = 0.10000002384185791016, so x' - 0.1 (deciaml value) = 2.384185791015625 * 10^-8

C. How far off would the computed clock have been after 100 hours of operation?
> 2.384185791015625 * 10^-8 * 60 * 60 * 100 * 10 (system increment per 0.1
> seconds) = 0.085824 second

D. How far off would the program’s prediction of the position of the Scud
missile have been?
> 2000 * 0.085824 = 171.648 meters
