k = 2 \
n= 2 \
biases = 2^(2-1) - 1 = 1
V = 2^E x M

Denormalized:

- E = 1 - Bias
- M = f

Normalized:

- E = e - Bias
- M = 1 + f

special case: \
when exponent is all 1s, and fraction is all 0s: \
    - when s=0, +ve infinity \
    - when s = 1, -ve infinity
when exponent is all 1s, and fraction is not all 0s: \
    - NaN

if n=2, smallest postive integer that cannot be represented is 2^2+1 = 5

2^24+1 = 16777217
