Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated when
solving Problem 2.19.

>> Equation 2.5 shows that if x is >= 0, Two coplent number to unisgned number
would have the same binary representation, only when x is less than 0, then
unsigned number will be larger than two representation number. The magnitude of
difference is the value represented by the most significant bit (since it is
being used as neagtion bit)
