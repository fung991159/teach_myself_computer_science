A. For an array of odd length cnt = 2k + 1, what are the values of variables
first and last in the final iteration of function reverse_array?
>> the values of first and last would be equal

B. Why does this call to function inplace_swap set the array element to 0?
>> whenever the array is odd length, first and last will be swapping the value
in the same address. Due to the XOR properties of a ^ a = 0, it will always
return 0.

C. What simple modification to the code for reverse_array would eliminate
this problem?
>> in the for loop statment, remove the equal sign so that the loop stop before
first == last.
