As mentioned in Problem 2.6, the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal
representation 0x00359141, while the single-precision floating-point number
3,510,593.0 has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504. Derive this
floating-point representation and explain the correlation between the bits of
the integer and floating-point representations.

1. integer 3,510,593 in binary form is "1101010110000100000001"
2. Normalization: 1.101010110000100000001 * 2^21
3. Fraction Field: Drop the leading 1 from normalized representation, and add 2 zero at the end to make it 23 bits long: 10101011000010000000100
4. Exponent Field: add bias 127 to 21 from step 2 to get 148, then convert 148 to binary form: 10010100
5. sign bit: 0 as the integer is postive

The complete representation is: 0 10010100 10101011000010000000100
