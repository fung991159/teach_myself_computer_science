Fill in the following macro definitions to generate the double-precision values +∞,
−∞, and −0:
```
#define POS_INFINITY(1e400)
#define NEG_INFINITY(-POS_INFINITY)
#define NEG_ZERO(-1.0/POS_INFINITY)
```

You cannot use any include files (such as math.h), but you can make use of the
fact that the largest finite number that can be represented with double precision
is around 1.8 × 10308.

> basically it is quite out of the blue with "1e400", but the rest of the
> mathmatically relationship are quite clear.
