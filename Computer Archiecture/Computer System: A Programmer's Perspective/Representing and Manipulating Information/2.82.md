We are running programs where values of type int are 32 bits. They are repre-
sented in twoâ€™s complement, and they are right shifted arithmetically. Values of
type unsigned are also 32 bits.

We generate arbitrary values x and y, and convert them to unsigned values as
follows:

```
/* Create some arbitrary values */
int x = random();
int y = random();
/* Convert to unsigned */
unsigned ux = (unsigned) x;
unsigned uy = (unsigned) y;
```

For each of the following C expressions, you are to indicate whether or
not the expression always yields 1. If it always yields 1, describe the underlying
mathematical principles. Otherwise, give an example of arguments that make it
yield 0.


A. (x<y) == (-x>-y)
> FALSE. if x is INT_MIN, flipping x (as -x) will still return INT_MIN, so the right hand side cannot be valid 

B. ((x+y)<<4) + y-x == 17*y+15*x
> TRUE. x+y << 4 is equal to (x+y) * 16, with the +y-x it is equal to right hand side

C. ~x + ~y+1 == ~(x+y)
> TRUE. every time a number is flipped, it is equal to negative of its orignal
> value - 1. Since on the left hand side there are 2 flip operation, vesus there
> is only 1 flip operation on right hand side, so it is necessary to add
> back one to compensate for the difference

D. (ux-uy) == -(unsigned)(y-x)
> TRUE. The difference betwen x and y in either int or unsigned int make no difference

E. ((x >> 2) << 2) <= x
> TRUE. The first right shift opeartion is gonna lose some bits, no matter how
> small it is, the best case is not losing any bit. So small than equal to
> original x value make sense
