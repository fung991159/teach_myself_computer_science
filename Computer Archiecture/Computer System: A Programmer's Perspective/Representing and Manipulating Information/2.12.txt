Write C expressions, in terms of variable x, for the following values. Your code
should work for any word size w ≥ 8. For reference, we show the result of evalu-
ating the expressions for x = 0x87654321, with w = 32.

A. The least significant byte of x, with all other bits set to 0. [0x00000021]

expression: x & 0xFF

Value:  0x87654321
Result: 0x00000021


B. All but the least significant byte of x complemented, with the least significant byte left unchanged. [0x789ABC21]

expression: x ^ ~0xFF
mask:   0xFFFFFF00
Value:  0x87654321
Result: 0x789ABC21

C. The least significant byte set to all ones, and all other bytes of x left un-
changed. [0x876543FF]

expression: x | 0xFF
Value:  0x87654321
Result: 0x876543FF
