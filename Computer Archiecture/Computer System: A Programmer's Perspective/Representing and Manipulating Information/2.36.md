For the case where data type int has 32 bits, devise a version of tmult_ok (Problem 2.35) that uses the 64-bit precision of data type int64_t, without using division.

```
/* Determine whether the arguments can be multiplied
without overflow */
int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {

    /* Compute product without overflow */
    int64_t pll = (int64_t) x*y;

    /* See if casting to int preserves value */
    return pll == (int) pll;
}
```

>> reference to solution, it does do the trick by casting dtype to 64 bit
