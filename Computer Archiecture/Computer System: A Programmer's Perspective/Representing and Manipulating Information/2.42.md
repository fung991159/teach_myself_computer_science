### Write a function div16 that returns the value x/16 for integer argument x. Your function should not use division, modulus, multiplication, any conditionals (if or ?:), any comparison operators (e.g., <, >, or ==), or any loops. You may assume that data type int is 32 bits long and uses a twoâ€™s-complement representation, and that right shifts are performed arithmetically.


```
int div16(int x) {
    /* Compute bias to be either 0 (x >= 0) or 15 (x < 0) */
    int bias = (x >> 31) & 0xF; 
    return (x + bias) >> 4;
}
```
> Basically it is "(x<0 ? x+(1<<k)-1 : x) >> k, without using conditional
> (x >> 31) gives all 0 if x is positive, 1 if x is negative
> bitwise mask with "& 0xF" (Decimal: 15) makes bias = 0 if (x is positive), 15 if x is negative
