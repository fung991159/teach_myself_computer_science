Write a C expression that will yield a word consisting of the least significant byte of
x and the remaining bytes of y. For operands x = 0x89ABCDEF and y = 0x76543210,
this would give 0x765432EF.

```
char merge_bytes(int x, int y)
{
    printf("x in bytes: ");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&x, sizeof(int));
    printf("y in bytes: ");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&y, sizeof(int));

    int least_significant_byte = x & 0xFF;
    printf("least_significant_byte: ");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&least_significant_byte, sizeof(int));

    int most_significant_byte = y & ~0xFF;
    printf("most_significant_byte: ");
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&most_significant_byte, sizeof(int));
    
    printf("combined: ");
    int result = least_significant_byte | most_significant_byte;
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&result, sizeof(int));
}
```
