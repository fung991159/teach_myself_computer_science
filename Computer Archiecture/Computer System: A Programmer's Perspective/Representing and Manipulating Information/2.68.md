Write code for a function with the following prototype:
/*
* Mask with least signficant n bits set to 1
* Examples: n = 6 --> 0x3F, n = 17 --> 0x1FFFF
* Assume 1 <= n <= w
*/
int lower_one_mask(int n);
Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164). Be
careful of the case n = w.

> this was easier than I thought, however, I probably didn't cater for n=w, but
> seems neither is any online solution did that, so I don't really have clue.
```
// show_bytes((byte_pointer)&n, sizeof(n));
int w = sizeof(int) << 3; // Compute the number of bits in an integer
int all_ones = ~0;

int shifted = all_ones << n;
printf("shifted:");
show_bytes((byte_pointer)&shifted, sizeof(shifted));

int result = ~shifted;
printf("result:");
show_bytes((byte_pointer)&result, sizeof(result));
```
