You are given the task of patching the vulnerability in the XDR code shown in
the aside on page 136 for the case where both data types int and size_t are 32
bits. You decide to eliminate the possibility of the multiplication overflowing by computing the number of bytes to allocate using data type uint64_t. You replace the original call to malloc (line 9) as follows:

```
uint64_t asize = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
void *result = malloc(asize);
```
Recall that the argument to malloc has type size_t.

A. Does your code provide any improvement over the original?
>> No, ele_cnt is int while ele_size is unsigned integer. The multiplication operation would be an unsigned one. If malicious programmer passed in negative value for ele_cnt, then uint64_t would still be overflowed

B. How would you change the code to eliminate the vulnerability?
>> we need to make sure all the type is the same, so making sure ele_cnt is unsigned type in the first place should do. 

>>>> the answer is more brilliant, it seems a common trick to check for overflow is to first carry out the compute process, then check it against a casted version of the variable
```
    uint64_t required_size = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size; # safe mulplication to make sure overflow doesn't break program
    size_t request_size = (size_t) required_size  # do the casting to get different in number representation, if any

    if (required_size != request_size)
        /* Overflow must have occurred. Abort operation */
        return NULL;
```
