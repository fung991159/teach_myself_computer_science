Given a floating-point format with a k-bit exponent and an n-bit fraction, write
formulas for the exponent E, the significand M, the fraction f , and the value V
for the quantities that follow. In addition, describe the bit representation.

> just a warm up question for IEEE special case

V = (-1)^s * M * 2^E
bias = 2^(k-1) -1, 

A. The number 7.0
>
E = e - Bias
e =  7
bias = 2^(k-1) -1, 
M = 1 + f, 
f = 0 
V = 2^(7- bias) * 1


B. The largest odd integer that can be represented exactly
> largest odd interger = ...11.01, the second least significant bit is 1, the rest is 1
e = 2 ^ k - 2^1
V = 2^((2 ^ k - 2^1) - bias) * 1


C. The reciprocal of the smallest positive normalized value
> smallest normalized: s=0, all k bits except lsb is 0, all f is 0
E = 1 - (2^(k-1) -1)
M = 1
