### For each of the following values of K, find ways to express x * K using only the specified number of operations, where we consider both additions and subtractions to have comparable cost. You may need to use some tricks beyond the simple form A and B rules we have considered so far.

|    K | Shifts | Add/Subs |        Expression         |
| ---: | :----: | :------: | :-----------------------: |
|    7 |   1    |    1     |         x<<3 - x          |
|   30 |   4    |    3     | x<<4 + x<<3 + x<<2 + x<<1 |
|   28 |   2    |    1     |        x<<5 - x<<2        |
|   55 |   2    |    2     |      x<<6 - x<<3 - x      |


I am not sure how the last one work though
