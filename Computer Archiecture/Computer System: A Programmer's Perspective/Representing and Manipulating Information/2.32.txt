You are assigned the task of writing code for a function tsub_ok, with arguments
x and y, that will return 1 if computing x-y does not cause overflow. Having just
written the code for Problem 2.30, you write the following:

/* Determine whether arguments can be subtracted without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy. */
int tsub_ok(int x, int y) {
    return tadd_ok(x, -y);
}

>> mathmatically (x-y) is equall to (x + (-y)). However, since Two complement
number is assynmetic. When it come to Tmin Y. There is no symmetric value to
represent the postive side of the number, hence an overflow would have happen.
So -y = y = Tmin.
