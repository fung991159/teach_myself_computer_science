In the following code, we have omitted the definitions of constants M and N:
```
#define M
 /* Mystery number 1 */
#define N
 /* Mystery number 2 */
int arith(int x, int y) {
    int result = 0;
    result = x*M + y/N; /* M and N are mystery numbers. */
    return result;
}
```
We compiled this code for particular values of M and N. The compiler optimized the multiplication and division using the methods we have discussed. The following is a translation of the generated machine code back into C:
```
/* Translation of assembly code for arith */
int optarith(int x, int y) {
    int t = x;
    x <<= 5;
    x -= t;

    if (y < 0) y += 7; 
    y >>= 3; /* Arithmetic shift */
    return x+y;
}
```
What are the values of M and N?

> M=31, since optarith make use of Form B of multiplication, so M = x*2^5 - x = 31x.
> N=8 or -8. since y need to shift by k=3. We don't know whether N is positive or negative since it is catered by "if (y < 0) y += 7; "
