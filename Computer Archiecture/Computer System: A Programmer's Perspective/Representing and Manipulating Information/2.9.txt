Computers generate color pictures on a video screen or liquid crystal display
by mixing three different colors of light: red, green, and blue. Imagine a simple
scheme, with three different lights, each of which can be turned on or off, project-
ing onto a glass screen:
Light sources
Red
Green
Glass screen
Observer
Blue
We can then create eight different colors based on the absence (0) or presence
(1) of light sources R, G, and B:


Each of these colors can be represented as a bit vector of length 3, and we can
apply Boolean operations to them.

A. The complement of a color is formed by turning off the lights that are on and
turning on the lights that are off. What would be the complement of each of
the eight colors listed above?

color   complement color
Black   White
Yellow  Red
Green   Magenta
Cyan    Red


B. Describe the effect of applying Boolean operations on the following colors:
                R   G   B
Blue | Green =  0   1   1   = Cyan
Yellow & Cyan = 0   1   0   = Green
Red ^ Magenta = 0   0   1   = Blue
