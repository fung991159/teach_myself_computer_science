You are given the task of writing a procedure int_size_is_32() that yields 1
when run on a machine for which an int is 32 bits, and yields 0 otherwise. You are
not allowed to use the sizeof operator. Here is a first attempt:

/* The following code does not run properly on some machines */
int bad_int_size_is_32() {
/* Set most significant bit (msb) of 32-bit machine */
int set_msb = 1 << 31;
/* Shift past msb of 32-bit word */
int beyond_msb = 1 << 32;
}
/* set_msb is nonzero when word size >= 32
beyond_msb is zero when word size <= 32
 */
return set_msb && !beyond_msb;
When compiled and run on a 32-bit SUN SPARC, however, this procedure
returns 0. The following compiler message gives us an indication of the problem:
warning: left shift count >= width of type
168

 Representing and Manipulating Information
A. In what way does our code fail to comply with the C standard?
> Integer overflow error, the maximum bit size of integer is 32 bits, hence
> beyond_msb shift the 1 bit to 33 bit position caused an error

B. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is at least 32 bits.
>> simple, just check if the msb represent the 32 bit min integer
```
int int_size_is_32()
{
    // get the bit lenght of integer
    // int bit_length = sizeof(int) * 8;
    int w = sizeof(int) << 3;
    int set_msb = 1 << w - 1; // set msb to 1, and the rest 0. So it is the most negative number of integers: -2147483648
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&set_msb, sizeof(unsigned int));
    return set_msb == -2147483648;
}
```
C. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is at least 16 bits.
```
int int_size_is_16()
{
    // get the bit lenght of integer
    // int bit_length = sizeof(int) * 8;
    int w = sizeof(int) << 3;
    int set_msb = 1 << w - 1; // set msb to 1, and the rest 0. So it is the most negative number of integers: -2147483648
    show_bytes((byte_pointer)&set_msb, sizeof(unsigned int));
    return set_msb == -32768;
}```
