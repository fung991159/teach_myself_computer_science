Write C expressions that evaluate to 1 when the following conditions are true and
to 0 when they are false. Assume x is of type int.
A. Any bit of x equals 1.
B. Any bit of x equals 0.
C. Any bit in the least significant byte of x equals 1.
D. Any bit in the most significant byte of x equals 0.
Your code should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164), with the
additional restriction that you may not use equality (==) or inequality (!=)
tests.

> basically only the first function need to be constructed, the rest can be
> derived from A, since the advantge of binary is it is either 0 or , so
> essential equals to 1/0 basically is asking for the same thing. While C and D
> is just mixing the masking operation that has been used all the time in other exercise
