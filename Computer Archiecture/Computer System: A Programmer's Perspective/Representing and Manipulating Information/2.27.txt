Write a function with the following prototype:

/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */

int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y);


This function should return 1 if arguments x and y can be added without
causing overflow.


int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y)
{
    // definition of overflow is when either x or y is larger than the sum of x
    // + y.

    unsigned s;
    s = x + y;
    return s > x;
};
