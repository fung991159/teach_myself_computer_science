### For a run of ones starting at bit position n down to bit position m (n â‰¥ m), we saw that we can generate two forms of code, A and B. How should the compiler decide which form to use?

Form B is always a constant operation, 2 Shift and 1 subtraction.
Form A Shift and add count depens on the length of the run of ones.

when n=m, Form A only takes one shift and no addition
when n = m+1, both form requires two shift and one add/sub operation
when n > m+1, Form B is more efficient
