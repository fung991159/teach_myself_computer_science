### How could we modify the expression for form B for the case where bit position n is the most significant bit?

```Form B: (x<<(n + 1)) - (x<<m)```

if n is the most significant bit, it won't matter as everything in that wordsize
were shift away, returning 0 for sure. Hence we are left we "-(x<<m)"
