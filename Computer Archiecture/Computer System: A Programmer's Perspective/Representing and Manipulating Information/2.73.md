Write code for a function with the following prototype:
```
/* Addition that saturates to TMin or TMax */
int saturating_add(int x, int y);
```
Instead of overflowing the way normal twoâ€™s-complement addition does, sat-
urating addition returns TMax when there would be positive overflow, and TMin
when there would be negative overflow. Saturating arithmetic is commonly used
in programs that perform digital signal processing.
Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules (page 164).

```
int saturating_add(int x, int y)
{
    int mask = INT_MIN; // 0x8000 0000
    int sum = x + y;

    // these two flags are to indicate if msb of input x and y is different than sum
    int positive_flag = !(x & mask) && !(y & mask) && (sum & mask);
    int negative_flag = (x & mask) && (y & mask) && !(sum & mask);

    // if positive_flag is true, then assign sum to INT_MAX, elif negative_flag
    // is true, then assign sum to INT_MIN, else sum can remain unchanged since
    // there is no overflow
    (positive_flag && (sum = INT_MAX)) || (negative_flag && (sum = INT_MIN));
    return sum;
}
