Suppose we are given the task of generating code to multiply integer variable x
by various different constant factors K. To be efficient, we want to use only the
operations +, -, and <<. For the following values of K, write C expressions to
perform the multiplication using at most three operations per expression.
A. K = 17
B. K = −7
C. K = 60
D. K = −112

> this is rather straight forward

```
int mul_a(int x)
{
    return (x << 4) + x;
}

int mul_b(int x)
{
    return -(x << 3) + x;
}

int mul_c(int x)
{
    return (x << 6) - (x << 2);
}

int mul_d(int x)
{
    return -(x << 7) + (x << 4);
}
```
