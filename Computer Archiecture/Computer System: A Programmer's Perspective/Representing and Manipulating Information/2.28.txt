We can represent a bit pattern of length w = 4 with a single hex digit. For an
unsigned interpretation of these digits, use Equation 2.12 to fill in the
following table giving the values and the bit representations (in hex) of the
unsigned additive inverses of the digits shown.


     x                       -u4x
hex     Decimal     Decimal     Hex
1          1        16-1=15      F
4          4        16-4=12      C
7          7        16-7=9       9
A          10       16-10=6      6
E          14       16-14=2      2
