We are running programs on a machine where values of type int have a 32-
bit twoâ€™s-complement representation. Values of type float use the 32-bit IEEE
format, and values of type double use the 64-bit IEEE format.
We generate arbitrary integer values x, y, and z, and convert them to values
of type double as follows:

```
/* Create some arbitrary values */
int x = random();
int y = random();
int z = random();

/* Convert to double */
double dx = (double) x;
double dy = (double) y;
double dz = (double) z;
```

For each of the following C expressions, you are to indicate whether or
not the expression always yields 1. If it always yields 1, describe the underlying
mathematical principles. Otherwise, give an example of arguments that make
it yield 0. Note that you cannot use an IA32 machine running gcc to test your
answers, since it would use the 80-bit extended-precision representation for both
float and double.

A. (float) x == (float) dx
> TRUE, since bit representation is gonna be same, while double can hold all value in float, so this is going to be the same

B. dx - dy == (double) (x-y)
> TRUE. as double is 64 bit and int is 32 bit.

C. (dx + dy) + dz == dx + (dy + dz)
> TRUE. the casted double number is gonna be the same, order of plus operation doesn't matter.

D. (dx * dy) * dz == dx * (dy * dz)
> FALSE, can overflow since the maximum of 3 x 32bit can exceed 64 bits

E. dx / dx == dz / dz
> FALSE. 0 can be either positive or negative.
