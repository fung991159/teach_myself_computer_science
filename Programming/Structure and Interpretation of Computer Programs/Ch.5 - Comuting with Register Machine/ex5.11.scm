Exercise 5.11: When we introduced save and restore in
Section 5.1.4, we didnâ€™t specify what would happen if you
tried to restore a register that was not the last one saved, as
in the sequence
716
(save y) (save x) (restore y)
There are several reasonable possibilities for the meaning
of restore:

a. (restore y) puts into y the last value saved on the
stack, regardless of what register that value came from.
Tsis is the way our simulator behaves. Show how to
take advantage of this behavior to eliminate one in-
struction from the Fibonacci machine of Section 5.1.4
(Figure 5.12).




b. (restore y) puts into y the last value saved on the
stack, but only if that value was saved from y. other-
wise, it signals an error. Modify the simulator to be-
have this way. You will have to change save to put
the register name on the stack along with the value.

>> "make-save" should have a table of stack, where the key is the name of the register. "make-restore" would then first lookup and return the stack of the register.


c. (restore y) puts into y the last value saved from
y regardless of what other registers were saved after
y and not restored. Modify the simulator to behave
this way. You will have to associate a separate stack
with each register. You should make the initialize-
stack operation initialize all the register stacks.
