1. Any programming language implicitly assumed infinitely memory,
but the real world computer is not the case, hence "garbage collection",
to reclaim memory that are occupied by object that is no longer required
in the process.
2. the book introduced "stop-and-copy" method for garbage collection, which
works with dividing all memory into two half. "working memory" and free memory".
When working memory is full, the still in use object will be copy over to free
memory. Hence squeezing out memory out of unused objects. The cycle repeat in
other direction.
3. the implementation is interesting as well, there will be two pointers, "free"
and "scan". "free" i sa pointer point to free memory, and incremented when ever
and new write happened. "scan" is the pointer doing the checking on wokring
memory, so it will check what object have or have not been moved to new working memory.
