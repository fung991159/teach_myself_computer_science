1. A compiler translate user program into machine code, the language need to be
the same for the compiler and user program

interpretor and user program doesn't need to be in the same program, all it does
is read user program, and decide which machine code to fire. The best example is
Python with it's CPython Interpreter

2. The implementation of the compiler is very complex, I gave up the pursuit in
the middle of the chapter, hoping to come back when I attain more experiences.
