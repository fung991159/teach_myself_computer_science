1. This section introduces the core of the "interpreter",
it is rather similar to metric curricular interpreter in ch.4
2. Compare with Compiler, interpreter is slower, because it need to save and
restore different section of the machine code and state all the time. Compiler
can skip some of the step if it isn't necessarily. However, interpreter does
have the advantage of debugging line by line and get to the state of the
register since the code are "interpreted" line by line.
