1. Introduction of data path and controller.
2. introdcution of "continue", where the machine code should excute next
3. Turn out "Stack" is among the most important data structure, since it is how
recursion is rely on. Usually the flow is to save the current env / value of
certain item that needed compute, and continue stacking up in the stack
structure. Finally when it reach the bottom, then rewind the process and finish
the compute.
