Exercise 5.20: Draw the box-and-pointer representation
and the memory-vector representation (as in Figure 5.14)
of the list structure produced by
  (define x (cons 1 2))
  (define y (list x x))
with the free pointer initially p1. What is the final value of
free ? What pointers represent the values of x and y ?

>> did my best attempt at ex5.20.png, however, not sure why index 0 never have any item, also where is the free pointer at the end?
