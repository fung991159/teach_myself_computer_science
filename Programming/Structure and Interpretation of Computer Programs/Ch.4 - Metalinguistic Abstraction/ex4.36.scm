Exercise 4.36: Exercise 3.69 discussed how to generate the
stream of all Pythagorean triples, with no upper bound on
566
the size of the integers to be searched. Explain why simply
replacing an-integer-between by an-integer-starting-
from in the procedure in Exercise 4.35 is not an adequate
way to generate arbitrary Pythagorean triples.

>> i, j, k will always move in sync, hence the procedure will never end as no solution could be found

Write a pro-
cedure that actually will accomplish this. (that is, write a
procedure for which repeatedly typing try-again would in
principle eventually generate all Pythagorean triples.)

>> no clue
