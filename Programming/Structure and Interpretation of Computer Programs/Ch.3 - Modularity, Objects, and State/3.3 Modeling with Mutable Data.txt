1. mutators: abstraction that modify data objects.
2. Data objects that has a mutators defined are known as mutable data objects.
3. With mutatable object, we need to face the "sameness" issue of an object
object build with cons can refer to the same list
4. eq? can be used to test whether x and y are the same object (i.e. if they
have equal pointers)
5. queue is a FIFO that new item add to the queue will be append last, while
delete item will start from first.
6. queue have front and rear pointer, so no matter how long the queue is,
it takes one step to add to the queue at the end.
7. deque (double ended queue) is enhanced queue with ability to add from front,
and delete from the end, with one step of course.
8. table (hash table): has table is a list with "dummy record" as car,
    another list in cdr. with each element in this list, the caar is the "key",
    while cadr is the "value".
    a lookup can be a theta n step process if loop through entire table to search
    for key; or a one step process if using b tree.
