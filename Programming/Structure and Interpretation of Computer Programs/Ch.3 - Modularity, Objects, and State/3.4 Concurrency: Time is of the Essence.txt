1. Assignemnt introduced the concept of time in a procedure. And it produce
even more problem when in a concurrent system. The remedy are:
    1. don't allow for concurrency when there is risk of data race (very inefficient)
    2. mimick the result of sequenial run even the process is runnig in parallel
    3. locking: the concept of a "mutex" is introduced. It is kind of a "decorator"
    to put on procedure, where it need to wait for the "Go" signal in an internal list
    before excuting a procedure. Hence ensure only single process can run in one time.
