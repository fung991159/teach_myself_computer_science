1. streams: construct a stream partially, just enough to produce the required part.
    a. "delayed evaluation" can be thought of as demand-driven programming,
    each stage is activated only enough to get to the next stage.
    b. it is pretty ingenious to put the "delayed" part into a lambda function to make
    it a "delay eval promise object"
2. To enable a stream function to loop itself with an initial value, it must introduced
the concept of delay evaluation on the streaming part. But this will introduce two version
of streaming procedure, one with delay and one without. One way to avoid this is to turn all
arguments into a delayed version, but this will mess with functino that use assignment and keep state!
