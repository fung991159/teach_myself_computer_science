Comment:
    1. closure (mentioned again) - a attributes of compounded data that any elements be composed of itself.
    i.e. one of the elements of a pair can in turn be another pair.

Exercise 2.17. Define a procedure last-pair that returns the list that contains only the last element of a
given (nonempty) list:
(last-pair (list 23 72 149 34))
(34)

>> piece of cake
(define (last-pair lst)
  (if (null? (cdr lst))
    (car lst)
    (last-pair (cdr lst))
  )
)


Exercise 2.18. Define a procedure reverse that takes a list as argument and returns a list of the same
elements in reverse order:
(reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
(25 16 9 4 1)
