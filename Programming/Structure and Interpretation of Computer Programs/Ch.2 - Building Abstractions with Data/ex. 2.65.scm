; Exercise 2.65: Use the results of Exercise 2-63 and Exercise 2-64 to give Î˜(n) implementations of
; union-set and intersection-set for sets implemented as (balanced) binary trees.41

; basically just call tree->list for the union-set operation before processing, and convert it back to tree afterward
; same for intersection-set
